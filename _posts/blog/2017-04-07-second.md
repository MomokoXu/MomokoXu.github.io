# Keep fighting for it and never give up!

I tried a lot of different stuff this year. Finally, I am very happy that
I am now fully comfortable with programming and coding. I feel so proud of
myself because I used to be so scared about CS but now I love it and on my way
to improve my personal skills and I believe I can reach my goal at the end.
